* Renamed append/prepend to prefix/suffix respectively. **NOTE :** this affects `a1111_ui.json` config options. Rename manually if you created a custom `my_a1111_ui.json` config
* Prefix, Suffix and User Tag Filters are now applied dynamically on each generation
* Previously saved prompts can now be deleted from cache via `Delete` button
